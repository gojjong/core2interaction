        <p>For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my desperate intent.</p>
        <p>At once I realized that this would be impossible. The advice about turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths.</p>
        <p>I know something about labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen</p>
        <p>He was Governor of Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose themselves.</p>
        <p>He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his labyrinth. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver1">
       <p>Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea;</p>
       <p> I imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms ... </p>
       <p>I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver2">
        <p>Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted. For an undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator.</p>
        <p>The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="ver8">
        <p>The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight. </p>
        <p>A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance. </p>
        <p>I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, streams, or the West wind. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver4">
        <p>Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. </p>
        <p>Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. </p>
        <p>Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. </p>
        <p>That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands.</p>
        <p>The stuttering sparks of the music kept on. </p>
