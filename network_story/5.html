        <p>"Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, laquered writing cabinet. 

     
          </p>

          <p>     "An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed...!"
         </p>
         <p> 
          "A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of time. </p>
          <p>I, a barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery.  </p>
          <p>After more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have happened. At one time, Ts'ui Pen must have said; 'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am retiring to construct a maze.' Everyone assumed these were separate activities.</p>
          <p> No one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same. The Pavilion of the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden. This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver9">
        <p>"Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no one could find the labyrinth. The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver10">
        <p>Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem.</p>
        <p> First, the curious legend that Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of a letter which I discovered." </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver2">
        <p>Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. He opened the top drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet.   </p>
        <p>He returned holding in his hand a piece of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded with the passage of time: </p>
        <p>it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular. Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly famous. Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which a man of my own blood had written with a small brush:</p>
        <p>"I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver3">
        <p>I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went on: 

         
          </p>

          <p> "Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite.  </p>
          <p>I could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. A volume whose last page would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely. </p>
          <p>I recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell the story of The Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity. </p>
          <p>I also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each individual would add a new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ver6">
        <p>"I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. I do not find it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric. In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, it was a despised one.    </p>
        <p>Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere novelist.</p>
        <p>Now then, this is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden.  </p>
        <p>He does not even use the word which means time.</p>
        <p>How can these voluntary omissions be explained?"</p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver1">
        <p>I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate. We discussed them. Finally Stephen Albert said: 
          </p>
        <p>"In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word is the only one prohibited?" </p>
        <p>I thought for a moment and then replied: 

          "The word is chess." </p>
