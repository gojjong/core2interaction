          I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty out my pockets.
          </p>
          <p>I found just what I knew I was going to find. The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which I decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a revolver with a single bullet.</p>
        <p>Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance. </p>

      <div class="ver5">
      <p>In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person capable of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train. </p>
      <p>I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me.</p>
      <p> I wished to prove to him that a yellow man could save his armies</p>
      <p>Besides, I had to escape the Captain. His hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver6">
        <p>Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out.</p>
       <p>The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being recognized.</p>
       <p>The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and vulnerable</p>
       <p> I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness. </p>


      </div>

      <div class="ver4">
        <p>I was going to the village of Ashgrove,</p>
        <p>but took a ticket for a station further on. The train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages.</p>
        <p> I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver3">
        <p>At last the train pulled out.</p>
        <p> A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform. It was Captain Richard Madden. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ver7">
        <p>The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field.</p>
        <p>No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out. </p>
        <p>A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. One of them asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?"</p>
        <p>Without waiting for my answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad."</p>
