            <p class="text"> I am a coffe bean. I grew up in a coffee plantation in Indonesia, with all the other coffee beans, bathed in the sun and fed by the rich soil. </p>
                <p class="text">But one day, a dark-skinned man plucked me and my friends, took us away from our home, and a moment later, I was placed in a curved container. </p>

                <p > <a href="../story_telling/plot4.html">The  head of a giant cat popped up and licked me together with other coffee beans into its mouth. It was hot, 
                    humid and rancid, and I had to watch my companions dissolve, one by one, into unknown liquids and mashes and . I felt terrible.</a> </p>
                <p class="text">I do not know how long after, I finally squeezed out from a gap, and got to take a breathe of the fresh air again. I was polished, washed, packaged 
                    and put on a plane for a new journey with many of my new companions who were as clean as I was.</p>
                <p class="text"> Then we all came to the last stop of life, Germany. After fine grinding and processing, we became a cup of mellow coffee. My body has disintegrated, 
                    but I am really proud of my dedication.</p>
