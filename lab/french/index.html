                <p>Remember: Pomme is negative, ananas is positive. Rule: almost all nouns ending in tion, sion, ture, sure, que, ie, ette, te, ille are feminine; Nouns ending in ment, isme, eme, eme and il are almost all masculine. Most of the CE-ending patients were negative. The positive endings of age, eau are in the majority; Most of the consonant ending is positive; Other nouns ending in "e" tend to be feminine, but if "e" is preceded by "x" or has more than one consonant, the ratio is almost equal.</p>
                <p>According to a study by McGill University, a noun’s ending indicates its gender in 80% of cases . Based on this study, here is a list of typically masculine and typically feminine noun endings.

                    Nouns with these endings were found to be of the same gender in more than 90% of cases.
                    
                    Unless you really like memorizing lists, I don’t recommend you learn these endings by heart, since the process would be extremely boring. Instead, bookmark this page and regularly look at the list. Or print it out and hang it somewhere you often linger – for example, beside your bathroom mirror, by the sink where you wash the dishes, or even by your toilet.
                    
                    After a while, you’ll see that you can intuitively guess the gender of a noun based on its ending.
